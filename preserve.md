# Foundation: Idea for preserving data on the internet

The purpose of this page is to preserve Finnish PC games from roughly 1987 -> 2004. This was the original `golden age` of Finnish indie game development. The resulting idiosyncratic games got nicknamed `Suomipelit` and they quickly gained cult classic status.

The scene had many domestic websites providing download links and basic information but year by year one or two of them would get sunset. The free hosting providers went down, people lost interest, and so on. Right now, the games are about to disappear from the internet completely.

This is probably true for a lot of data. The expectation that "once it's on the internet, data is forever" is only true for profitable data.
A large part of 90's and 2000's internet is very quickly disappearing for good. Because no one thought to save it. The Internet Archive can only save a small partial snapshot.
For these games there really isn't an online source left anymore and they are only alive in a small Torrent, drifting out into the void.

Hosting a few gigabytes long term is very cheap and very easy these days. The core data should be duplicated in multiple data stores. A copy in Google Drive, in Dropbox, in AWS, Torrent, heck- a treasure map to a weather-proofed USB stick. Same with links and instructions to the data. Github Pages is a good example of a longer-term link collection.
